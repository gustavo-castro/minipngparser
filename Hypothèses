- When no header is found, the parser will raise an error
- When no data is found, the parser will raise an error
- If the file does not start with the exact string "Mini-PNG", the parser will raise an error
- If more than a header is declared, the parser will raise an error
- If the palette contains more than 256 colors, the parser will raise an error
- If the dimensions represent an image that has less pixels than the file's data, I fill the image
with the data until all the image is filled (some data will remain unused)
- If the dimensions represent an image that has more pixels than the file's data, I raise an error 
- I test if the blocks follow their descriptions by only seeking for their data exactly in the lengths they described, at the end,
if there's no block starting after them, I raise an error
