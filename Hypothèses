- When no header is found, the parser will assume the pixel type is black and white
- When no data is found, the parser will print the black image with the dimensions described in the header
- If there's no data nor header, an error will be raised
- If the file does not start with the exact string "Mini-PNG", it will not be parsed
- If more than a header is declared, the parser will raise an error
- If the palette contains more than 256 colors, it will raise an error
- For the black and white images, if the dimensions don't match the data size, I adjust them as described in the code
- For other pixel types, if the dimensions don't match the data, I will create the image with the described dimensions, 
and fill the data as possible (possibly leaving black pixels in the end, or not using the whole data if doesn't match the
dimenions)
- I test if the blocks follow their descriptions by only seeking for their data exactly in the lengths they described, at the end,
if there's no block starting after them, I raise an error
