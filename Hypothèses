- When no header is found, the parser will raise an error
- When no data is found, the parser will raise an error
- If the file does not start with the exact string "Mini-PNG", the parser will raise an error
- If more than a header is declared, the parser will raise an error
- If the palette contains more than 256 colors, the parser will raise an error
- If the dimensions don't match the data, I will create the image with the described dimensions, 
and fill the data as possible (possibly leaving black pixels in the end, or not using the whole data if doesn't match the
dimenions)
- I test if the blocks follow their descriptions by only seeking for their data exactly in the lengths they described, at the end,
if there's no block starting after them, I raise an error
